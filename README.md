# Gimlet is a tiny Blog API

This illustrates a basic API for blogging with a simple CRUD interface over REST.

## Purpose

a real production application.**

The purpose is to show the basic usage of:

* [falcon web framework][1] for building RESTful APIs
* [pyresttest][2] for end-to-end testing of RESTful APIs
* [AngularJS][3] for building CRUD-based Single Page Applications in JavaScript
* and [Docker][4] for distributing the whole stack
